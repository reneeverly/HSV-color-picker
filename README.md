# HSV-color-picker
An HSV color picker implemented in JS, targeting wide browser compatibility.

I initially created this to provide an alternative color picker for Flash MX, modeled loosely after contemporary color pickers in programs like Krita, CSP, and PaintTool SAI.

## Targets
* [x] Firefox 12.0 (Windows 2000)
